Linux-Implementation Details: 
	In this project, we created a distributed file server using UDP as a underlying layer. We implemented
	the mfs.c file. It has seven defined funcitons in it. We use these seven functions as commands to 
	connect to remote sever and made it as a shared library. We also implemented the server function. In
	the server funciton, we first opened the server file image, and get the proper infomations(superblock, 
	inodes, bitmaps). We then checked each command and implemented proper the command function. 

XV6-Implementation Details:
	We wish to drop this one(p5b).
